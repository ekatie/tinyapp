# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Functional Details

- Users can register to access functions available to signed in users.
- Signed in users can: 
  - BROWSE: a list of their short URLs
  - READ: detailed URL information, including creation date and visitor tracking data
  - EDIT: long URLs asssociated with existing short URLs
  - ADD: new short URLs
  - DELETE: generated URLs
- Tracking of visits to short URLs:
  - Total number of visits
  - Number of unique visits
  - List of visits by visitor ID and timestamp for visit
- Permissions:
  - Generated short URLs and visitor tracking data are private (only visible to the user who created them)
